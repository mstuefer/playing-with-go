# playing-with-go

A little collection of several go-apps, useful while learning the open source programming language Go. Mainly (slightly changed/annotated) stuff out of the great book: "[The Go Programming Language](https://gopl.io/)" from Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan. Find the official book repo [here](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/).
